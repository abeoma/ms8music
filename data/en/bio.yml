designation : Singer-songwriter/Guitarist
longDescription : |-
  Mamoru is a Japanese blues musician with an international background. He was born in Tokyo, but he has grown up in different countries and has travelled the world with his guitar, which makes him have multicultural and diverce experience, as a person and as a musician.
  His play style is based on Blues/R&B/Soul. You can hear both bluesy tasty phrases and catchy melody in his music, which comes from his big influences from John Mayer, Eric Clapton and The Beatles.
  He owns his uniqueness with his smoky voice, bluesy tasty guitar, funky groove, and jazzy harmony.

  He has played guitar for German TV advert (check out the video below please), and played festivals in Germany and Croatia, not just gigging around in Europe, in North America and in Japan.
  He started off his music career from busking in Galway, Ireland, after graduating from
  the London Centre of Contemporary Music in 2014. He gradually gained reputations by busking and got bigger opportunities based on that.

  He has been playing music in more than 25 cities, 10 countries (including major cities like London, Tokyo, Montreal, New York City, Los Angeles etc).
