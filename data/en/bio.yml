longDescription : |-
 Masa (Mamoru Satoh) is a Japanese artist with a multicultural background, having grown up in Japan, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. He has been traveling the world with his guitar. He started out busking in Galway, Ireland, and has built a reputation one performance at a time.

 Highlights of his journey have been recording guitar for a German TV advertisement, playing music festivals in Europe (with ex-Weather Girls Ingrid Arthur and others), and playing shows in over 10 countries and 25 cities including London, Tokyo, New York City, Berlin, Montreal, and so on.

 Masa creates a unique Neo City Pop sound with smoky vocals, tasty blues guitar, and laid back jazz harmony. His music style emanates the sounds of blues, soul, and jazz and combines them with catchy melodies.

 Throughout the traveling experiences, Masa found that you can learn a lot from different cultures. One of his dreams is to spread the virtuous nature of Japanese culture through his musical journey. He enjoys playing in cultural events and music festivals. To pursue this dream Masa created Neo Tokyo, a Japanese cross-cultural community on Discord welcome to all. (https://discord.gg/QyEQBY6)
