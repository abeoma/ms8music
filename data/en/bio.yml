designation : Singer-songwriter/Guitarist/Painter
longDescription : |-
 Mamoru is a Japanese artist with a multicultural background, having grown up in Japan, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and traveling the world with his guitar since graduating from the London Centre of Contemporary Music in 2014. He started out busking in Galway (Ireland), and has built a reputation one performance at a time.

 Highlights of his journey has been recording guitar for a German TV advert (please check out the video below), playing music festivals in Europe, and playing shows in over 10 countries, including cities like London, Tokyo, Montreal, New York City, and Los Angeles.

 His music style emanates elements from Blues/R&B/Soul/Funk with catchy melodies. He is also deeply influenced by John Mayer, Eric Clapton and The Beatles. With a smoky voice, tasty blues guitar, and laid back jazz harmony, he strives to found a unique sound.

 He is also active in the community, giving music workshops, like Rock camp in Pula (Croatia) for beginners and advanced players.
 Please feel free to contact him about lessons, community workshops, and performances.
