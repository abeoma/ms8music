longDescription : |-
  Mamoru is a Japanese artist with an International background.
  He was born in Tokyo, and he has grown up in different countries and has travelled the world with his guitar, which makes him have multicultural and diverse experience.
  He started his music career from busking and built the reputation from there.
  He has played guitar for German TV advert (please check out the video below), played music festivals in Europe, and played shows over 10 countries, 25 cities in Europe / North America / Japan (including major cities like London, Tokyo, Montreal, New York City, Los Angeles etc).
  
  His music style is based on Blues/R&B/Soul/Funk. You can hear both black music elements and catchy melodies in his music, which come from his big influences from John Mayer, Eric Clapton and The Beatles.
  He's got his own uniqueness by his smoky voice, tasty bluesy lines, and jazzy laid back harmony etc.

He has great teaching experience of private lessons as well as workshops (Rock camp in Pula, Croatia), ranging from complete beginners to advanced players.
